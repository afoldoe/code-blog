I took on the styling for the page, including implementing a form template we found appealing. The fuctonality pertaining to the bike shop section was also my work. I created a simple pop up div to show more detailed information on the bikes for sale. As most nonprofit bike shops in Portland accept bike donations, I included a form to collect user input on the bike and its details they would like to donate along with their contact informaton.</p>"

Once the song is selected, users can then choose which YouTube karaoke video they would like to play. I implemented the client-side functionality, about half the styling on the page, and set up a database to store user's favorite songs. </p>",
